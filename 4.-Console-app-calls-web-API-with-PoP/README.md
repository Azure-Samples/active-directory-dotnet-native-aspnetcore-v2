# Sign-in a user with the Microsoft Identity Platform in a console application and call an ASP.NET Core web API using Proof of Possession token

As of MSAL .NET 4.23, Proof of Possession (which was available under an experimental feature flag), is no longer exposed in public client applications.

See the dot net core [daemon app sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/tree/master/4-Call-OwnApi-Pop) showing the usage of Proof of Possession (Pop) in confidential client applications
